# configure-as-labmachine

Download this project into an openSUSE Leap 15.0/15.1/15.2/15.3, openSUSE Tumbleweed or SLE 15 SP1/SP2/SP3 image and run the `configure-as-labmachine.sh` script (as root or via sudo) to configure that image to be basically the standard SUSE Training lab machine image.

Once the machine has been configured as a lab machine, if there are additional disks attached, the `create-and-mount-courses-disk.sh` and `create-and-mount-home-disk.sh` scripts can be used to automatically partition/format and then mount the additional disks on `/install/courses` and `/home` in the case that the additional disk space is needed for the lab environments to be installed and run (i.e. as in Azure).


**Note**:  This automatically adds the following software repositories:

  * google-chrome
  * Cloud:Tools
  * X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go

If you would like to add the packman repo, edit the `config/configure-as-labmachine.cfg` file and uncomment and move the packman repo into the `ZYPPER_REPOS_LIST` variable. You may add any additioinal repos to that variable as well (ensuring that the URL is correct for the distro).
